# HackerEarth_Resolving_citizens_grievances

Human rights are one of the key conditions for an individual or a community to thrive. 
All citizens should be allowed to exercise their basic rights irrespective of race, sex,
national or social origin, religion, political or other views, and more, to live with
dignity, freedom, equality, justice, and peace.   

You work for a non-governmental organization that helps people voice their grievances.
With your expertise in Machine Learning, you plan to develop a predictive model that will 
help the government prioritize grievances of complainants for resolution. Build a
sophisticated Machine Learning model that predicts the importance of a citizenâ€™s 
grievance while considering various articles, constitutional declarations, enforcement,
resources, and so on.
